# Explore_US_Bikeshare
2016 US Bike Share Activity Analysis
## Overview
In this project, I make use of Python to explore data related to bikeshare systems for three major bikeshare systems in the United States. 
I performed data wrangling to unify the format of data from the three systems and write code to compute descriptive statistics.
